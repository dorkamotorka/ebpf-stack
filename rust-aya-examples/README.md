# Rust Aya Example

There are many great resources, for developing eBPF programs using Aya that do much better job explaining the concepts than I ever could, so I'll just refer to a few to get you started: 

- [eBPF Aya Book](https://aya-rs.dev/book/)
- [Examples of small eBPF projects based on Aya](https://github.com/vadorovsky/aya-examples/tree/main)
- [Head First eBPF Aya Example](https://www.ebpf.top/en/post/ebpf_rust_aya/)
